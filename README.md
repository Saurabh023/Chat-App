# Chat-App

In this project, I have build an chat app using React.JS and firebase google authentication to authenticate an user. It is not completed yet. I am learning Backend Development with the help of this project by implementing various functionalities. I will progress as I learn new stuff. 

For now, I have only implemented Authentication functionality properly. In which, a user can register/sign-in with their google authentication.

Note: You need to allow pop-up to authenticate.
